BrewCalc - Sinatra
==================

BrewCalc re-imagined as a simple Sinatra app. To what end? To introduce myself to Sinatra.

What does it do?
----------------

In an attempt to speed up volume calculations on brew-days, this app will calculate and visualize water/wort height, based on my three kettle brew-system and various other system variables.

Note: this is a work in progress. See original project here: https://github.com/joelkbennett/BrewCalc
